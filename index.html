                <p>There are four main parts for OET exam to assess the English language proficiency of the test taker,
                    this includes reading, writing, speaking, and listening. OET scorecard depicts the results on a
                    scale of 0-500 for each session with respective grade letter( usually from A to E) provided on a
                    scale. But the overall OET grade is not specified in the scorecard, So it is onto the candidates to
                    analyze and calculate the overall grade.</p>
                <p> For your analysis, we are sharing the numerical scale of OET scorecard and the respective grades
                    associated with it.
